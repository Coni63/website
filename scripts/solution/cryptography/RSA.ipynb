    "\n",
    "Let's assume you are Amazon. You have several customer and you need to ask them secrets informations that only you should be able to decrypt. To do so, the RSA works with 2 keys :\n",
    "- 1 Private key allowing you to decrypt the code\n",
    "- 1 Public key to share will all users to encode the information\n",
    "\n",
    "When you ask the consumer for a sensitive information, they encrypt this information using the Public key and send this to the network. If someone else, receive it, they won't we able to decrypt it as they have only the public key. However, with your private key, you (and only you) can decrypt this information. That's why the private key must remain secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a hacker and you want to break the private key to decrypt the information you have stolen in the network, you will need to do a Prime Factorization which is a very complex problem. \n",
