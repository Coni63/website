    " \tThe Goal\n",

    "Binary with 0 and 1 is good, but binary with only 0, or almost, is even better! Originally, this is a concept designed by Chuck Norris to send so called unary messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that takes an incoming message as input and displays as output the message encoded using Chuck Norris’ method.\n",
    "\n",
    " \tRules\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the encoding principle:\n",
    "\n",
    "The input message consists of ASCII characters (7-bit)\n",
    "The encoded output message consists of blocks of 0\n",
    "A block is separated from another block by a space\n",
    "Two consecutive blocks are used to produce a series of same value bits (only 1 or 0 values):\n",
    "- First block: it is always 0 or 00. If it is 0, then the series contains 1, if not, it contains 0\n",
    "- Second block: the number of 0 in this block is the number of bits in the series\n",
    " \tExample\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a simple example with a message which consists of only one character: Capital C. C in binary is represented as 1000011, so with Chuck Norris’ technique this gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "0 0 (the first series consists of only a single 1)\n",
    "00 0000 (the second series consists of four 0)\n",
    "0 00 (the third consists of two 1)\n",
    "So C is coded as: 0 0 00 0000 0 00\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Second example, we want to encode the message CC (i.e. the 14 bits 10000111000011) :\n",
    "\n",
    "0 0 (one single 1)\n",
    "00 0000 (four 0)\n",
    "0 000 (three 1)\n",
    "00 0000 (four 0)\n",

We can see that there is multiple way to handle variables (we can merge strings or use a list instead). The solution 1 is the \"most\" logic one and works well for small data but if you want to convert a book, you should definitely use the generator way and provide it some chunk of the book."
