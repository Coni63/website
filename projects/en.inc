On this dataset there were a lot of missing or incorrect data. The purpose of this project was therefore to clean up/filter the incorrect data. In parallel with the cleaning, a univariate and multivariate exploration was done to determine the most important parameters to healthy dishes (in order to help a company to set up healthy recipes).");

define("_P3_DESC", "During this second project, the objective was to implementate unsupervised algorithms on a dataset of movies. Based on a movie selected by a user, the model must recommend 5 similar movies that should be appreciated too.</br></br>Based on a simple dataset, with only 28 features, a cleaning pahse and data preparation was done. After that, different Clustering algorithms (or manifolds) were tested and evaluated on the relevance of the prediction on a set of predefined movies.");

This dataset includes several millions of flights with different information (company, date and time of departure/arrival, airports of departure and destination, etc ...). From this dataset, a delay prediction model had to be implemented.</br></br>During this project, a restriction on models was \"requested\". Despite the number of data and the relevance of using a Recurrent Neural Network on this type of dataset, a linear model has been set up. As a comparison, a temporal model (\"ARIMA\") has also been tested.");

Then using various aggregations to have additional features (purchase frequencies, average bill price, time since the last purchase, ...) a new dataset per customer was set up. Starting from this new dataset, a second clustering was set up to segment the clients. After an analysis of clusters and related behaviors, a classifier was put in place to predict which category a client could be.

From this dataset, supervised and unsupervised methods were put in place to make a system of predicting tags to a given question.</br></br>After a pre-processing phase (tokenization, lemmatization), the TF and TF-IDF matrix were set-up. On these, unsupervised methods (Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Non Negative Matrix) were applied to predict tags using a KNN with the Jenson-Shannon distance. For the supervised method, various models with regularization were tested on the TF-IDF matrix with much better results.");

At first, we have to use only classical methods and then usign Convolution Neural Networks (Transfer Learning and Custom CNN).</br></br>For the classical method, a study of SIFT descriptors, colors, moments and image frequencies were done with very low results. For the Transfer Learning phase, performances are highly better with a classifier like Neural Networks. Finally, a training of zero was tested on few models to evaluate the relevance of Transfer Learning on this type of tasks.");

A comparaison of all them has been done on a fixed dataset to see performances and training time.

I decided to work on a competition where we are asked to perform an image segmentation of Cells Nucleis.</br></br>After the pre-processing step, a first model based on image processing has been tried as baseline. After that, the model U-Net (reference model for this task - won ISBT in 2015) has been adapted to this specific task. The result was not as good as expected with issues with stability of training. As a result, I've tried a U-Net extednded which takes multiple inputs with diffÃ©rents pre-processing steps to help the model to segment the image. The result was clearly better. To finish, as step of Post-Processeing has been implemented to extract every nucleis and prepare the submission file. ");
